# Exercise provenance

Which CSwFP exercise each `CSwL` exercise comes from. This mapping
used to live in the book's own prose, as `Ref. CSwFP/4, exercício 4.9
(p. 74)` lines; the book must be self-contained and never name its
source, so those lines are removed and the correspondence is kept here
instead.

This file is for the instructor: checking coverage (which of the
book's exercises are ported, which are still missing) and finding the
original statement when an exercise needs revising. It is
documentation *about* the project, not part of the book.

The `CSwL id` column holds each exercise's `(name := …)`. Since the
rename of 2026-08-30 these are English mnemonics carrying no number,
so **this file is now the only link between an exercise and the
passage it comes from**. Keep it in step with any further rename.

`prose` marks an exercise whose answer is given in prose rather than
stated in Lean. In the source these carry a `✎` marker, which is
otherwise undocumented.

The book has 76 exercises as of 2026-09-13, and all but one of them
appear somewhere below — either in a table that names its source, or
in the list of those with no counterpart. Two checks keep it that way:
no `(name := …)` in `CSwL/` should be absent from this file, and no
name cited here should have stopped existing.

The exception is `free-vars-in-formula`, in `Logic/FOL.lean`, which has
no entry here; it predates the chapter reorganization of 2026-09-13 and
still needs one.

## A correction to the numbers

The 17 references in `Sets.lean` were all off by one chapter: they
read `CSwFP/2, exercício 3.N` where the book has **Exercise 2.N**. The
page numbers they cite were right, which is what makes the shift
visible — CSwFP's Exercise 2.1 is on p. 17, and the file cited
"exercício 3.1 (p. 17)". The book's chapter 2 has exercises 2.1 to
2.17, and there are exactly 17 of them.

The table below carries the corrected numbers. `IntroCS.lean`,
`Logic/PL.lean`, `Logic/FOL.lean` and `Morphology/Phonemes.lean` were
checked against the same source and are correct.

## Exercises taken from CSwFP

### `IntroCS.lean` — CSwFP/1

| CSwL id          | Rating | CSwFP        | Page |
|------------------|--------|--------------|------|
| `possibilities`  | 1      | Exercise 1.1 | 6    |
| `sentence-go-on` | 1      | Exercise 1.2 | 8    |

CSwFP Exercise 1.3 (infinitely many sentences, p. 8) is not ported.

### `Morphology/Phonemes.lean` — CSwFP/3.14

| CSwL id             | Rating | CSwFP                                   | Page  |
|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| `yawelmani-harmony` | 3      | Exercise 3.19 (Yawelmani vowel harmony) | 61–62 |

`feature-value` (rating 2) and `append-suffix-text` (rating 3) have no counterpart:
CSwFP hands `feature-value`/`fMatch` to the reader as given code, and `CSwL` turns
them into exercises.

### `Sets.lean` — CSwFP/2 (exercises `twice` and `adjective-types` moved on with CSwFP/2.4 and 2.5, to `IntroL.lean` and `English.lean`)

Note that 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 sit in the prose without an exercise
directive, so they get no rating, no solution elision and no
autograding.

Exercises 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 (`empty-subset`–`double-complement` above)
stay with this chapter when it moves after `Logic.lean`; 2.3 (`Ā̄ = A`)
is the one that needs classical reasoning, and is the reason for the
move.

### `SeaBattle.lean` - CSwFP/4.1

- Exercise 4.1 is `game-over-grammar` (prose now, but better change to Lean code)

### Mastermind — dropped

| — | — | Exercise 5.16 | — | dropped 2026-09-13 |

`Games/Mastermind.lean` was removed with the chapter reorganization: it was
disconnected from what preceded it, and it promised a semantics in
propositional logic that it never gave. Two exercises went with it,
`four-turn-game` and `chess-grammar`, along with CSwFP/5.13–5.16, which had no
`CSwL` counterpart in the first place.

### `InfEngine.lean` — CSwFP/5.7

| CSwL id | Rating | CSwFP         | Page | Notes      |
|---------|--------|---------------|------|------------|
| —       | —      | Exercise 5.28 | 109  | not ported |
| —       | —      | Exercise 5.29 | 109  | not ported |


## Exercises not ported, and why

An exercise absent from the tables above is a decision, not an oversight. The
reasons fall into three kinds.

**It asks for a construction the chapter does not have.** CSwFP/5.21 defines
substitution of a name for a variable in a term, and 5.22 asks for a truth
definition that replaces assignments by names plus substitution. Both need
substitution, which `FOL.lean` never defines, and writing it is a chapter's
worth of work, not an exercise's.

CSwFP/5.23 — the truth definition extended to structured terms — was unported
for the same reason until the `fol-terms` section was added: it needed the
interpretation of function symbols, which the chapter now has as `FInterp` and
`liftAssign`. The section supplies that development in the text, and
`lift-assign` above is the exercise drawn from it; 5.23 as stated asks for the
whole evaluator, which here is one instantiation of `Formula.eval` rather than
a second function.

**It is answered by something the chapter already states.** CSwFP/5.6 asks which
of three formulas are satisfiable, 5.7 which equivalences hold, 5.8 which
consequences hold, 5.19 and 5.20 the same for predicate logic. In this book
`satisfiable`, `equivalent` and `implies` are computable, so each of these is
`#eval` rather than a question — the answer is a keystroke, and the exercise
loses its point. They are worth keeping only if reformulated as proofs about
the definitions rather than queries against them.

For 5.19 and 5.20 this became true only with the chapter reorganization of
2026-09-13, which gave `FOL.lean` a computable `Formula.eval`; before that the
chapter had no way to evaluate a formula at all, and the two were unported for
want of a semantics rather than for having too easy an answer. They are now the
strongest candidates for reformulation as proofs, since the model to state them
against is in the chapter.

**It asks for a variant implementation.** CSwFP/5.11 asks for a check of logical
equivalence, which `Form.equivalent` already is; 5.12 asks to reimplement the
semantics with `[String]` instead of `[(String, Bool)]` for valuations.

CSwFP/5.18 is ported as `translate-quantified`. Its propositional counterpart,
4.9, was dropped; the two chapters no longer mirror each other here.

CSwFP/5.28 and 5.29 ask for soundness and completeness of the Aristotelian
inference system. Soundness is within reach — `InfEngine.lean` already proves
BARBARA, CELARENT and DARII valid over `Set` — but completeness needs a model
construction the chapter does not have.

Nine of the `Logic/FOL.lean` entries above were plain headings carrying the
book's page number rather than exercise directives; that is fixed.

## Exercises original to CSwL

No CSwFP counterpart. Listed so that "absent from the table above" is not read
as an oversight.

CSwFP's chapter 3 exercises 3.1–3.18 are not ported: they are about Haskell
itself (types of Haskell functions, Haskell programs to read). Exercise 3.18
(the type of `vh`, p. 54) belongs with Finnish vowel harmony and is the one
worth reconsidering.
