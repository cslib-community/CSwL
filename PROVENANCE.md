# Exercise provenance

Which CSwFP exercise each `CSwL` exercise comes from. This mapping used to live
in the book's own prose, as `Ref. CSwFP/4, exercício 4.9 (p. 74)` lines; the
book must be self-contained and never name its source, so those lines are
removed and the correspondence is kept here instead.

This file is for the instructor: checking coverage (which of the book's
exercises are ported, which are still missing) and finding the original
statement when an exercise needs revising. It is documentation *about* the
project, not part of the book.

The `CSwL id` column holds each exercise's `(name := …)`. Since the rename of
2026-08-30 these are English mnemonics carrying no number, so **this file is
now the only link between an exercise and the passage it comes from**. Keep it
in step with any further rename.

`prose` marks an exercise whose answer is given in prose rather than stated in
Lean. In the source these carry a `✎` marker, which is otherwise undocumented.

The book has 81 exercises as of 2026-09-02, and every one of them appears
somewhere below — either in a table that names its source, or in the list of
those with no counterpart. Two checks keep it that way: no `(name := …)` in
`CSwL/` should be absent from this file, and no name cited here should have
stopped existing.

## A correction to the numbers

The 17 references in `Sets.lean` were all off by one chapter: they read
`CSwFP/2, exercício 3.N` where the book has **Exercise 2.N**. The page numbers
they cite were right, which is what makes the shift visible — CSwFP's
Exercise 2.1 is on p. 17, and the file cited "exercício 3.1 (p. 17)". The book's
chapter 2 has exercises 2.1 to 2.17, and there are exactly 17 of them.

The table below carries the corrected numbers. `IntroCS.lean`, `Logic/PL.lean`,
`Logic/FOL.lean` and `Morphology/Phonemes.lean` were checked against the same
source and are correct.

## Exercises taken from CSwFP

### `IntroCS.lean` — CSwFP/1

| CSwL id | Rating | CSwFP | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| `possibilities` | 1 | Exercise 1.1 | 6 |
| `sentence-go-on` | 1 | Exercise 1.2 | 8 |

CSwFP Exercise 1.3 (infinitely many sentences, p. 8) is not ported.

### `Morphology/Phonemes.lean` — CSwFP/3.14

| CSwL id | Rating | CSwFP | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| `yawelmani-harmony` | 3 | Exercise 3.19 (Yawelmani vowel harmony) | 61–62 |

`feature-value` (rating 2) and `append-suffix-text` (rating 3) have no counterpart:
CSwFP hands `feature-value`/`fMatch` to the reader as given code, and `CSwL` turns
them into exercises.

### `Sets.lean` — CSwFP/2 (exercises `twice` and `adjective-types` moved on
with CSwFP/2.4 and 2.5, to `IntroL.lean` and `English.lean`)

| CSwL id | Rating | CSwFP | Page | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `empty-subset` | 1 | Exercise 2.1 | 17 | |
| `empty-vs-singleton` | 1 | Exercise 2.2 | 17 | prose |
| `double-complement` | 2 | Exercise 2.3 | 17 | prose |
| `cartesian-square` | 2 | Exercise 2.4 | 18 | |
| `successor-composition` | 2 | Exercise 2.5 | 18 | |
| `converse-subset` | 2 | Exercise 2.6 | 18 | |
| `which-are-transitive` | 2 | Exercise 2.7 | 19 | |
| `transitive-iff-comp` | 2 | Exercise 2.8 | 19 | |
| `transitive-not-idempotent` | 2 | Exercise 2.9 | 19 | |
| `successor-as-relation` | 1 | Exercise 2.10 | 21 | |
| `leq-as-function` | 1 | Exercise 2.11 | 21 | |
| `graph-is-functional` | 2 | Exercise 2.12 | 21 | |
| `twice` | 1 | Exercise 2.13 | 26 | |
| — | — | Exercise 2.14 | 26–27 | prose; not in an `:::exercise` block |
| — | — | Exercise 2.15 | 28 | prose; not in an `:::exercise` block |
| — | — | Exercise 2.16 | 28 | prose; not in an `:::exercise` block |
| `adjective-types` | 1 | Exercise 2.17 | 30 | |

Note that 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 sit in the prose without an exercise directive,
so they get no rating, no solution elision and no autograding.

Exercises 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 (`empty-subset`–`double-complement` above) stay with this chapter when it
moves after `Logic.lean`; 2.3 (`Ā̄ = A`) is the one that needs classical
reasoning, and is the reason for the move.

### `Logic/PL.lean` — CSwFP/4.4

| CSwL id | Rating | CSwFP | Page | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | Exercise 4.9 | 74 | dropped 2026-09-02 |
| `exclusive-or` | 1 | Exercise 4.10 | 74 | |
| — | — | Exercise 4.11 | 74 | dropped 2026-09-02 |
| `count-operators` | 1 | Exercise 4.12 | 75 | |
| `formula-depth` | 1 | Exercise 4.13 | 75 | |
| `collect-atoms` | 2 | Exercise 4.14 | 75 | |

Exercises 4.9 and 4.11 were ported and then dropped when the chapter was
restructured around worked arguments. 4.9 asked for three sentences to be
translated into propositional logic; `exchange-prop`, `dresses` and `bangu-form`
ask the same thing of arguments the reader then has to prove or settle, which is
the same skill with a use attached. 4.11 asked for unique readability, which the
chapter had already reduced to constructor injectivity — see `DEVIATIONS.md` on
why the original claim dissolves — and the section that carried it, along with
the parenthesis-counting results of Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2, went with
the restructuring.

### `Logic/FOL.lean` — CSwFP/4.5–4.7

| CSwL id | Rating | CSwFP | Page | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `predicate-unique-readability` | 2 | Exercise 4.15 | 77 | prose |
| `infinite-predicates-bnf` | 1 | Exercise 4.16 | 77 | prose |
| `bound-occurrences` | 1 | Exercise 4.17 | 78 | prose |
| `closed-form` | 2 | Exercise 4.18 | 81 | |
| `implication-as-abbrev` | 1 | Exercise 4.19 | 82 | |
| `negation-normal-form` | 2 | Exercise 4.20 | 82 | |
| `term-parse-tree` | 1 | Exercise 4.21 | 83 | prose |
| `vars-in-formula` | 1 | Exercise 4.22 | 84 | |
| `open-form` | 2 | Exercises 4.23 and 4.24 | 84 | merged |

All ten are `:::exercise` directives. Nine of them were plain `#` headings
carrying the source's page number until 2026-08-30; 4.23 and 4.24 became one
exercise, since 4.23 asked for the function that 4.24 builds on.

## Exercises not ported, and why

An exercise absent from the tables above is a decision, not an oversight. The
reasons fall into three kinds.

**It asks for a construction the chapter does not have.** CSwFP/5.21 defines
substitution of a name for a variable in a term; 5.22 asks for a truth
definition that replaces assignments by names plus substitution; 5.23 asks for
the truth definition extended to structured terms. All three need substitution,
which `FOL.lean` never defines, and 5.23 additionally needs the interpretation
of function symbols. Writing those constructions is a chapter's worth of work,
not an exercise's.

**It is answered by something the chapter already states.** CSwFP/5.6 asks which
of three formulas are satisfiable, 5.7 which equivalences hold, 5.8 which
consequences hold, 5.19 and 5.20 the same for predicate logic. In this book
`satisfiable`, `equivalent` and `implies` are computable, so each of these is
`#eval` rather than a question — the answer is a keystroke, and the exercise
loses its point. They are worth keeping only if reformulated as proofs about
the definitions rather than queries against them.

**It asks for a variant implementation.** CSwFP/5.11 asks for a check of logical
equivalence, which `Form.equivalent` already is; 5.12 asks to reimplement the
semantics with `[String]` instead of `[(String, Bool)]` for valuations.

CSwFP/5.13–5.16 belong to Mastermind and are recorded with `Games.lean`.
CSwFP/5.18 is ported as `translate-quantified`. Its propositional counterpart,
4.9, was dropped; the two chapters no longer mirror each other here.

CSwFP/5.28 and 5.29 ask for soundness and completeness of the Aristotelian
inference system. Soundness is within reach — `InfEngine.lean` already proves
BARBARA, CELARENT and DARII valid over `Set` — but completeness needs a model
construction the chapter does not have.

Nine of the `Logic/FOL.lean` entries above were plain headings carrying the
book's page number rather than exercise directives; that is fixed.

CSwFP's chapter 3 exercises 3.1–3.18 are not ported: they are about Haskell
itself (types of Haskell functions, Haskell programs to read). Exercise 3.18
(the type of `vh`, p. 54) belongs with Finnish vowel harmony and is the one
worth reconsidering.

## Section-level references

These were also `Ref.` lines in the book's prose. The chapter-level mapping now
lives in `DEVIATIONS.md`; this table records the finer-grained pointers that
existed inside chapters.
